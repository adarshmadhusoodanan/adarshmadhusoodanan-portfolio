## About Me

I'm Adarsh Madhusoodanan, a passionate and results-oriented developer with a strong foundation in **backend engineering** and a keen interest in **Artificial Intelligence**. I thrive on building practical, efficient solutions to real-world problems and have a proven track record of leading community initiatives and driving technical growth.

My journey in tech is fueled by a simple philosophy: **learn by building**. Whether it's developing a full-stack application, diving into the latest AI models, or mentoring fellow students, my goal is to create a tangible impact.

### My Journey & Experience

I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects that have shaped my skills:

-   **AI Engineering Intern at Sixtysixtech**: I'm currently building a sophisticated AI voice agent for US clients, diving deep into the world of interface-less technology.
-   **MakeMyPass Development Team**: As part of this team, I helped build an AI-powered WhatsApp bot for seamless event registration, a project that taught me a great deal about creating user-centric solutions.

I'm also proud of my work in building and leading the **MuLearn chapter at CETKR**, where I fostered a vibrant community of learners and helped my peers develop practical tech skills.
