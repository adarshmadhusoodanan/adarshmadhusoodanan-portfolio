In college, it's easy to get caught up in the race for good marks. But as I moved through my engineering degree, I realized that academic success doesn't always translate to practical, real-world skills. This is the story of how I moved beyond my textbooks and started building something more.

### The Spark: From Discord to a Realization

During my second year, I spent my free time exploring tech communities on Discord and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. It was a world away from lectures and examsâ€”a place where people were building real things and learning from each other.

By my third year, I noticed a trend in my college. Many of us had excellent grades, but when it came to practical tech skills, we were all starting from scratch, including me. The curriculum gave us a strong theoretical foundation, but it didn't teach us how to build, ship, and collaborate on modern tech projects. I saw a clear gap and an opportunity to change things.

### Building a Community from Scratch

I decided to start a community where students could learn new technologies through mutual learning. The idea was simple, but the execution was tough. Starting something new in a college environment, where routines are already set, is a significant challenge.

My solution was to bring a chapter of [MuLearn](https://mulearn.org) to our campus. MuLearn is a fantastic organization that promotes a culture of peer-to-peer learning, where students can work on projects, earn Karma points, and get recognition for their skills. It was the perfect framework for what I wanted to achieve.

I founded the **[MuLearn CETKR](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mulearn-cetkr)** chapter and took on the role of **Campus Lead** starting in October 2024. After my initial term, I continued to contribute as a **Student Mentor** from February 2025 onward. This ongoing journey has been an incredible experience, teaching me about leadership, people management, and the power of community. We've created a space where students are genuinely excited to learn and grow together.

### Your Turn to Build

My journey taught me that the most valuable learning often happens outside the classroom. Don't just be a student who studies; be an explorer. Find a community, contribute to a project, or start something of your own. Your future self will thank you for it.
