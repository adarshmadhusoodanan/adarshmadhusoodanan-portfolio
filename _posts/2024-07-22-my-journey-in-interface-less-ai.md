I recently came across a simple but powerful idea: **"Think interface-less"**. It suggests a future where our interactions with technology are free from the distractions of screens—a future driven by voice, chat, and even thought. This concept immediately resonated with me, as it perfectly captures the essence of what I've been working on.

### MakeMyPass: Event Registration Through WhatsApp

My first real dive into this idea was with the **MakeMyPass dev team**, where we developed an AI WhatsApp bot for event registrations. Instead of a clunky web form, users could simply chat with our bot to register. The conversation flowed naturally, and the AI handled the details. It was a practical solution that met users where they already were: on their phones, using a familiar app. This project showed me that a simple chat interface could be more effective than a traditional screen-based one.

### Sixtysixtech: Building an AI Voice Agent

I'm currently an AI Engineering Intern at **Sixtysixtech**, where I'm building an AI voice agent for US clients. This project takes the interface-less concept a step further. There's no screen at all—just a voice. It’s a challenging but exciting space to be in, and it feels like I'm building for a future where technology is seamlessly integrated into our lives.

### Why This Matters

Thinking interface-less isn't about getting rid of screens entirely. It's about creating technology that is more intuitive, accessible, and less distracting. Whether it's a chatbot that simplifies a task or a voice agent that provides hands-free help, the goal is to make technology feel less like a tool and more like a partner.
